## 🧠 Pitch

Ever wanted to learn guitar 🎸 but only know how to code 💻?

**SkillSwap** is a smart, community-first platform that allows users to trade  
skills directly. No money involved — just mutual growth through skill sharing!

---

## 💡 Inspiration

Education and upskilling are often locked behind paywalls.  
What if people could grow together using what they already know?

SkillSwap reimagines the barter system for the 21st century — enabling people  
to teach what they know and learn what they don't, all within a single platform.
